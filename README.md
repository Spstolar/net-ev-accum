# net-ev-accum
Simulations for models of evidence accumulation on a network.

## survivalProb.py
Computes the survival probability for a single agent accumulating evidence. 

## threshOpt.py
This is a script for testing which thresholds are optimal for the unidirectional pair. It simulates the process as in survivalProb.py.
